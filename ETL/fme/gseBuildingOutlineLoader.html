		<h3>gseBuildingOutlineLoader</h3>
		<p>This process adds a new building outline polygon from a source CAD drawing, 
		and it also creates a Point inside the polygon that is used for Building and Floorplan mapping purposes.</p>
		<p>A key part of the processing is determining the rotation angle for the building so that buildings and floors can be rotated to 
		be horizontal on the screen/page in GIS applications.</p>
		<p>While it is technically possible to create the outline rectangles from the contents of a floorplan drawing plus world file, 
		it is more practical to create the rectangles in CAD to make sure that things are perfectly rotated and oriented.
