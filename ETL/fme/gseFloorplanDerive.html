		<h3>gseFloorplanDerive</h3>
		<p>This process creates derived data from the basic flooplan lines, spaces, and floor area polygons.</p>

		<p>There are 4 datasets that are updated in this process as shown below</p>
		<img src='{{ site.url }}/images/gseFloorplanDerive.png'></img>
		<p></p>
		<p>Each of these datasets has a different representation than the base Floorplan features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Floor_Area - An aggregate of the Floor_Poly features to ensure that there is one row per floor.</li>
			<li>Floor_Hull - A convex hull around the floor that can be used (i.e., with Data-Driven Pages and the Attribute Assistant) to capture floor attributes in GIS Applications.</li>
			<li>Floor_Point - A point with the same location as the BuildingOutline Point. This is used with Data-Driven pages to center the window on the exact same location for each floor in a building.
			These points can also be moved around to tailor the location of map views, the update process ignores geometry for these features.</li>
			<li>InteriorSpace_Point - A point inside the InteriorSpace polygons that can be used to support mapping and search capabilities.</li>
			<li>InteriorSpace_Tilt - An isometric view of the rooms for the floor that can be viewed and printed in 2D GIS applications with a 3D effect.</li>
        </ul>
