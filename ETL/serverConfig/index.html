		<h3>Sync Engine serverConfig Folder</h3>
		<p>This folder contains machine-specific settings for processing</p>
		<p>The .sde files in this folder are ArcGIS SDE Connection files. These contain the settings for the database server, database, and security. 
		All of the Sync Engine processing relies on these files, and the 2 main ones are GIS Staging.sde and GIS Production.sde. 
		These 2 files must be set to the correct databases.</p>
		<p>The xml configuration files have a number of settings that are specific to a particular process. Most of the time 
		gseDataConfig.xml is used for processing, and it has the following settings:
