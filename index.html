        <p>Sync Engine builds on the basic <a href='http://github.com/Gizinta/gzTools'>Gizinta library</a>. Gizinta makes it easier to move data between databases using XML configuration files to map source datasets to target data models. Gizinta also has 'playlists' - all Gizinta tools have the ability to run one or more datasets at a time, and this makes it possible to update parts or all of a target database by just passing an XML file to the process to be run.</p>

        <p>Sync Engine takes the Gizinta idea further by providing a way to execute enhanced playlists, and it updates the target database with change-only updates if all playlists run successfully. Playlists are enhanced with a reference to a <a href='http://www.safe.com'>Safe Software FME</a> process to run. The Gizinta XML files also contain additional details about database views to be created for change-only updates.</p>

        <p>The gseFP repository contains the code and the folder structure for the Sync Engine tools. Implementation projects are typically built and managed using Github private repositories, and they include most of the content from the gseFP project - with names like gseVT and gseUW.</p>	
        <h3>Folders</h3>
		<p>The project is organized into multiple folders. The base location for these files on disk is typically C:\Apps\Gizinta\gseFP or the specific project that you are working on.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="{{ site.url }}ETL/index.html">ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) Folder</a> - the ETL folder contains the scripts that run the tools, along with subfolders for different parts of the Sync Engine.</li>
			<li>Data Models Folder - the Data models folder contains Geodatabase Xml Workspace documents, Html documentation for the Staging, Production, and Publication databases, and sample data saved as 3 SQL Server Express databases.</li>
			<li>Docs Folder - the Docs folder contains more specific instructions on setting up your own project in MS Word documents. You can edit this to tailor the docs for your configuration.</li>
        </ul>
