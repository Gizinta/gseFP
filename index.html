        <p>gseFP contains the common files for the Gizinta Sync Engine Solution, and it can be extended for use on specific projects.</p>
        <p>Implementation projects are typically built using Github private repositories, and they include most of the content from the gseFP project - with names like gseVT and gseUW.</p>	
		
        <h3>Folders</h3>
		<p>The project is organized into multiple folders. The base location for these files on disk is typically C:\Apps\Gizinta\gseFP or the specific project that you are working on.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}ETL/index.html">ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) Folder</a> - the ETL folder contains the scripts that run the tools, along with subfolders for different parts of the Sync Engine.</li>
</ul>
